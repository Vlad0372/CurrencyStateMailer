# CurrencyStateMailer
The script sends a mail with a state of Swiss franc every 24 hours to a provided email. It uses PHPMailer library.

So to make this project work, you should create an account at https://sendgrid.com

The site will allow you to register your email in their mail server and after that, 
you can provide your unique api key and your email in the PHP script so it can function properly.
